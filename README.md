## Typography and color scheme
- The project utilizes the **Montserrat** font family from Google Fonts, while the primary font is Montserrat / the fallback font is Sans-serrif. As for the color scheme for the body `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ff9a00, #ee0979);` it ensures a vibrant orange for primary color `"ff9a00"` and bold pink for the secondary color `"ee0979"` while the `linear-gradient of 135deg` let's it flow diagonally from the bottom left to the top right with a value of 135degrees creating a smooth color change.
